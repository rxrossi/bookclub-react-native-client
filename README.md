# Bookclub client for FCC in React Native

## Info
Still a work in progress, working on presentational components using storybook

To get started, on one console:
```shell
  npm install
  npm run sbsv //Starts storybook server
```
Then on another console:
```shell
  npm start //Starts the app, that currently loads just the storybook
```

Follow instructions on console to open on Expo

## What is ready in storybook:
  - Login and Register (Made considering reusability and using HOC for 'going to the next field on return key press')
